<b>Key Features:</b>

- Automated Data Retrieval: Fetches data from a specified Zoho XLSX document using API authentication.
- Data Comparison & Analysis: Compares the latest data with the previously stored dataset to identify changes.
- Scheduled Execution: Runs at user-defined intervals, defaulting to every 12 hours.
- Telegram Integration: Sends processed results directly to a Telegram chat for easy monitoring.
